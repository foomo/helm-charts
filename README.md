# Helm Charts

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add foomo https://foomo.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo foomo` to see the charts.

<!-- Keep full URL links to repo files because this README syncs from main to gh-pages.  -->
Chart documentation is available in [foomo directory](https://github.com/foomo/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/foomo/README.md).
